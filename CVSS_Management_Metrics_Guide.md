# CVSS Vectors for Management Metrics: Technical Debt, Risk Matrix, and Compliance Mapping

## Executive Summary

Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) vectors contain rich metadata that extends far beyond simple risk scoring. By analysing CVSS vector components, security teams can generate actionable management metrics including technical debt quantification, remediation effort estimation, compliance mapping, and strategic security posture insights.

## 1. Technical Debt Quantification

### 1.1 Definition and Business Impact

Technical debt in cybersecurity represents the cumulative cost of unaddressed vulnerabilities over time. Unlike traditional technical debt (code quality), security technical debt compounds exponentially due to:
- **Exploitability Evolution**: Vulnerabilities become easier to exploit as attack tools mature
- **Asset Value Growth**: Systems become more critical as business scales
- **Compliance Drift**: Regulatory requirements become stricter over time

### 1.2 CVSS-Based Technical Debt Calculation

#### Primary Formula
```
Technical Debt = Σ(Vulnerability Impact × Time Decay × Exploitability Factor × Asset Criticality)
```

#### Component Breakdown

**Vulnerability Impact (VI)**
- Derived from CVSS Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability (CIA) metrics
- Formula: `VI = (VC + VI + VA) / 3` where each component is normalised 0-1

**Time Decay Factor (TDF)**
- Accounts for increasing exploitability over time
- Formula: `TDF = 1 + (days_since_disclosure / 365) × 0.1`
- Maximum decay factor: 2.0 (after 10 years)

**Exploitability Factor (EF)**
- Based on CVSS Attack Vector, Complexity, and Requirements
- Formula: `EF = (AV_weight + AC_weight + AT_weight) / 3`
- Where weights are: AV(N=0.85, A=0.6, L=0.55, P=0.2), AC(L=0.77, H=0.44), AT(N=0.85, P=0.62)

**Asset Criticality (AC)**
- Business-defined multiplier (1.0-5.0)
- Based on system importance, data sensitivity, regulatory requirements

#### Implementation Example
```javascript
function calculateTechnicalDebt(vulnerabilities, assetCriticality = 1.0) {
    return vulnerabilities.reduce((total, vuln) => {
        const cvss = parseCVSSVector(vuln.vector);
        const daysSinceDisclosure = (Date.now() - vuln.disclosureDate) / (1000 * 60 * 60 * 24);
        
        const impact = (cvss.VC + cvss.VI + cvss.VA) / 3;
        const timeDecay = 1 + (daysSinceDisclosure / 365) * 0.1;
        const exploitability = (cvss.AV + cvss.AC + cvss.AT) / 3;
        
        return total + (impact * timeDecay * exploitability * assetCriticality);
    }, 0);
}
```

## 2. Remediation Effort Estimation

### 2.1 Effort Scoring Matrix

CVSS vectors provide indicators for remediation complexity:

| CVSS Component          | Low Effort   | Medium Effort | High Effort               |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------- | ------------------------- |
| **Attack Vector**       | Physical (P) | Local (L)     | Network (N), Adjacent (A) |
| **Attack Complexity**   | High (H)     | Low (L)       | -                         |
| **Privileges Required** | High (H)     | Low (L)       | None (N)                  |
| **User Interaction**    | Active (A)   | Passive (P)   | None (N)                  |
| **Scope**               | Unchanged    | Changed       | -                         |

### 2.2 Remediation Effort Formula

```
Remediation Effort = Base Effort × Complexity Multiplier × Scope Multiplier × Priority Weight
```

#### Base Effort (Person-Days)
- **Low (1-3 days)**: Configuration changes, simple patches
- **Medium (4-10 days)**: Code changes, architectural modifications
- **High (11-30 days)**: Complete system redesign, major refactoring

#### Complexity Multipliers
```javascript
const complexityMultipliers = {
    // Attack Vector
    AV: { P: 0.5, L: 0.8, A: 1.2, N: 1.5 },
    // Attack Complexity  
    AC: { H: 0.7, L: 1.3 },
    // Privileges Required
    PR: { H: 0.6, L: 1.0, N: 1.4 },
    // User Interaction
    UI: { A: 0.8, P: 1.0, N: 1.2 }
};
```

#### Scope Multipliers
- **Unchanged (U)**: 1.0 (affects only vulnerable component)
- **Changed (C)**: 1.5 (affects multiple components)

### 2.3 Resource Planning Formula

```
Total Resources = Σ(Remediation Effort × Team Efficiency × Availability)
```

Where:
- **Team Efficiency**: 0.7-1.3 (based on team skill level)
- **Availability**: 0.8-1.0 (considering other commitments)

## 3. Risk Matrix Generation

### 3.1 Dynamic Risk Matrix

Traditional risk matrices use static likelihood/impact scales. CVSS-based matrices are dynamic and data-driven:

#### Likelihood Calculation
```
Likelihood = (Exploitability Score + Temporal Factors) / 2
```

Where:
- **Exploitability Score**: `(AV + AC + AT + PR + UI) / 5`
- **Temporal Factors**: `(E + AU + R) / 3` (from CVSS temporal metrics)

#### Impact Calculation
```
Impact = (Confidentiality + Integrity + Availability) / 3
```

### 3.2 Risk Matrix Implementation

```javascript
function generateRiskMatrix(vulnerabilities) {
    const matrix = {
        'Critical-High': [],
        'Critical-Medium': [],
        'High-High': [],
        'High-Medium': [],
        'Medium-Medium': [],
        'Low-Low': []
    };
    
    vulnerabilities.forEach(vuln => {
        const cvss = parseCVSSVector(vuln.vector);
        const likelihood = calculateLikelihood(cvss);
        const impact = calculateImpact(cvss);
        
        const riskLevel = determineRiskLevel(likelihood, impact);
        matrix[riskLevel].push(vuln);
    });
    
    return matrix;
}
```

## 4. Compliance Mapping

### 4.1 Regulatory Framework Mapping

CVSS vectors can be mapped to compliance requirements:

#### PCI DSS Mapping
```javascript
const pciMapping = {
    'Requirement 6.1': (cvss) => cvss.AC === 'L' && cvss.AV === 'N',
    'Requirement 6.2': (cvss) => cvss.VC === 'H' || cvss.VI === 'H',
    'Requirement 11.2': (cvss) => cvss.AV === 'N' && cvss.AC === 'L'
};
```

#### SOX Compliance
```javascript
const soxMapping = {
    'Financial Data Integrity': (cvss) => cvss.VI === 'H',
    'System Availability': (cvss) => cvss.VA === 'H',
    'Access Controls': (cvss) => cvss.PR === 'N' || cvss.PR === 'L'
};
```

### 4.2 Compliance Score Calculation

```
Compliance Score = (Compliant Findings / Total Findings) × 100
```

Where a finding is "compliant" if it meets the organisation's risk threshold for the specific regulation.

## 5. Security Posture Metrics

### 5.1 Attack Surface Analysis

#### Network Exposure Score
```
Network Exposure = Σ(CVSS Score × Network Factor) / Total Vulnerabilities
```

Where Network Factor = 1.0 if AV=N, 0.5 if AV=A, 0.2 if AV=L, 0.1 if AV=P

#### Privilege Escalation Risk
```
Privilege Risk = Σ(CVSS Score × Privilege Factor) / Total Vulnerabilities
```

Where Privilege Factor = 1.0 if PR=N, 0.6 if PR=L, 0.2 if PR=H

### 5.2 Security Maturity Index

```
Maturity Index = (Controlled Vulnerabilities / Total Vulnerabilities) × 100
```

Where "Controlled" means:
- High Attack Complexity (AC=H)
- High Privileges Required (PR=H)  
- Active User Interaction Required (UI=A)

## 6. Advanced Analytics

### 6.1 Vulnerability Clustering

Group vulnerabilities by CVSS vector similarity:

```javascript
function clusterVulnerabilities(vulnerabilities, threshold = 0.8) {
    const clusters = [];
    
    vulnerabilities.forEach(vuln => {
        const cvss = parseCVSSVector(vuln.vector);
        let assigned = false;
        
        clusters.forEach(cluster => {
            if (calculateSimilarity(cvss, cluster.centroid) >= threshold) {
                cluster.vulnerabilities.push(vuln);
                assigned = true;
            }
        });
        
        if (!assigned) {
            clusters.push({
                centroid: cvss,
                vulnerabilities: [vuln]
            });
        }
    });
    
    return clusters;
}
```

### 6.2 Trend Analysis

#### Vulnerability Velocity
```
Velocity = (New Vulnerabilities - Remediated Vulnerabilities) / Time Period
```

#### Risk Accumulation Rate
```
Accumulation Rate = Σ(CVSS Score × Time Weight) / Time Period
```

### 6.3 Predictive Modeling

#### Risk Projection
```
Projected Risk = Current Risk × (1 + Growth Rate)^Time Horizon
```

Where Growth Rate is calculated from historical CVSS data trends.

## 8. Conclusion

CVSS vectors provide a rich foundation for generating actionable management metrics that extend far beyond simple risk scoring. By leveraging the detailed component data within CVSS vectors, security teams can:

- **Quantify technical debt** in business-relevant terms
- **Estimate remediation efforts** for resource planning
- **Generate dynamic risk matrices** based on actual exploitability
- **Map compliance requirements** to specific vulnerabilities
- **Track security posture** evolution over time

These metrics enable security teams to communicate effectively with business stakeholders, justify security investments, and demonstrate measurable progress in risk reduction programmes.
