EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================
Total Findings: 6
Critical Findings: 1
Technical Debt: 3.85
Remediation Effort: 112.5 person-days
Security Maturity: 0%
Average Risk: 6.8/10

KEY INSIGHTS:
1. Significant remediation effort of 112.5 person-days needed
2. Low security maturity index of 0% indicates insufficient controls
3. 1 critical vulnerabilities pose immediate risk

TOP RECOMMENDATIONS:
1. Prioritise remediation of critical and high-severity vulnerabilities
2. Implement additional security controls to improve maturity index
3. Develop comprehensive remediation timeline based on effort estimates
4. Establish regular vulnerability assessment schedule

TECHNICAL DEBT ANALYSIS
======================
Total Technical Debt: 3.85
Average per Vulnerability: 0.64

REMEDIATION EFFORT ANALYSIS
===========================
Total Effort: 112.5 person-days
Average per Vulnerability: 18.7 person-days

SECURITY POSTURE ANALYSIS
=========================
Average Risk Score: 6.85/10
Security Maturity Index: 0%
Controlled Vulnerabilities: 0/6

MATHEMATICAL APPENDIX
=====================

Technical Debt Calculation:
TD = Σ(VI × TDF × EF × AC)
Where:
  VI = Vulnerability Impact = (VC + VI + VA) / 3
  TDF = Time Decay Factor = 1 + (Days_Since_Disclosure / 365) × 0.1
  EF = Exploitability Factor = (AV + AC + AT) / 3
  AC = Asset Criticality (1.0-5.0)

Remediation Effort Calculation:
FE = BE × CM × TE × A
Where:
  FE = Final Effort (person-days)
  BE = Base Effort (based on CVSS score)
  CM = Complexity Multiplier (product of component multipliers)
  TE = Team Efficiency (0.7-1.3)
  A = Availability (0.8-1.0)

Risk Matrix Calculation:
L = (ES + TF) / 2
Where:
  L = Likelihood (0-1)
  ES = Exploitability Score = (AV + AC + AT + PR + UI) / 5
  TF = Temporal Factors = (E + AU + R) / 3
